        content: "Nowadays with the development and advertisement of the human rights, an increasing number of people inside and outside the education fields claimed that the best approach to educate is to praise those positive behaviors and just ignore those unappropriated(未分配的) inappropriate actions. It is true that to praise the positive actions is beneficial at most time for students, but there is some circumstances under which to ignore negative behaviors is not so great as the best solution of teaching.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it is undoubted that it makes sense for students to give a smile to them when they do something right. It is pretty helpful for building their self-confidence, which is of a great significance in the modern society. The world today is laden with exploded information and severe competitions never seen at previous eras, adding too much for an individual. Students, due to their young ages, are subject to these factors in particular, and the exterior encouragement from people around them can definitely improve their courage and determination to conquer the difficulties in front of them ahead. In addition, sometimes the praise for the right things they have done involving learning can stimulate their interest in study, result in upgrade the performance to some extent. \n\nOn the other hand, to always ignore bad behaviors can't be a good ways to teach, let alone the best. at any time, there must be some students who think themselves as the best in the world and look down on everyone around them, both teachers and students. For these students, someone is needed to tell them what the fact is and that the way how they think about events and persons needs to be changed. Apart from that, another kind of students one can find in every school in the world is those who are too lazy to take the basic responsibilities for their living in the society. They should be told they are wrong and there is something they ought to take as the cost of breath. \n\nDuring the eduction, to blame or to criticize students for mistakes they have taken is never aimed at the wrong things, instead to decrease the possibility that the same mistake will be made for one more time. The best way of eduction is never defined as to praise what is right without mentioning what is wrong. It may be to control considerately the frequency of praises and blames depending on the characteristics of the students in consideration.",
